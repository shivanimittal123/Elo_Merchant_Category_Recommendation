# Elo_Merchant_Category_Recommendation

Elo is one of the largest payment brands in Brazil. It offers financial services, including debit card and credit card. 
Elo has built partnership with merchants in order to provide offers or discounts to the card holders. Elo has built several machine
learning models but none of the system provides personalized benefits to the customer. So, it organized a challenge on
Kaggle named “Elo Merchant Category Recommendation”.

The main aim behind this challenge is to develop a machine learning model which can predict the loyalty score of the card
holders using the customer transactions data. This model helps Elo to improve their customer experience by providing them
discount or offers based on their loyalty score.
